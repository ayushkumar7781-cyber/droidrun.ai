DroidRun AI - Intelligent Automation Agent

Overview:
DroidRun AI is a conceptual AI agent designed to observe system states, understand user intent,
and perform corrective or automated actions without continuous human intervention.

Problem:
Users often get stuck when apps freeze, crash, or behave unexpectedly.
Most users do not know what action to take next.

Solution:
DroidRun AI analyzes the situation, decides the next best action,
and executes it automatically to help the user.

Core Workflow:
1. Detect current state (app crash, freeze, idle, error)
2. Analyze possible actions
3. Choose the best action
4. Execute action
5. Learn from outcome (future scope)

Uniqueness:
- Designed for non-technical users
- Works as an intelligent helper
- Focus on decision-making logic, not just automation

Future Enhancements:
- Machine learning integration
- Android system-level control
- Voice-based commands
